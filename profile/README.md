### Story
«Our story began in 2020, when someone asked in a Telegram chat: "*Can you make a bot that will convert exchange rates?*" It was a great idea, and I didn't wait around. Overnight, I made the first prototype of the bot, which was named ERTB. It quickly won the hearts of users, and in a few months there were already hundreds of them, and in a couple of years - hundreds of thousands!

Bots are our hobby, but we also develop various web applications. We are not afraid of challenging tasks because we believe that no progress is regression. We always strive for new heights and achievements.

Our team consists of less than a dozen talented people who live in different parts of the world but share the same vision and goals. Most of them joined us not for the money, but for the opportunity to learn and develop.» © Andrii Volkov

### Description
Telegram bot for converting exchange rates “on the fly”. To use it, you do not need to use commands (for example, /convert). The bot is best suited for group chats with friends, colleagues, etc. from different countries. ERTB analyzes each message for numbers and currencies, and if it finds them, it immediately sends converted currencies at the current rates ( the required currencies can be configured in each chat separately). The bot's capabilities are not limited to group chats, it can also be used in private chat with the bot.

The bot can recognize not only simple structures (such as “$5” or “25 euros”), but also numbers written in letters and slang expressions (for example, “a dozen bucks”).

ExRates Connect API is the heart of currency exchange rates bots. Thanks to it, the bots have up-to-date exchange rates and search for currencies and numbers in the largest and most complex texts so quickly.

Stay tuned and wait for updates.
